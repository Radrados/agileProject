The repository should also include a folder called "deliverables", within the folder should be 3 short screen-capture video (.mp4) or image files (.jpeg, .png). These files should be added as the project progresses and each should:

1. show off the completion of a suitable intermediate deliverable as per the Agile methodology. The video or image should show the feature being demonstrated (audio on videos is allowed, but not required - unless audio is an important part of the feature).
2. be named the same as a Git tag in the project. That tag should point to the commit where the video/image was made.

The three deliverables will be:
1. v0.1_SignUp_and_Login_feature.mp4 -  the video will display a user signing up and entering the home page.
2. v1.0_Tags.mp4 - this video displays how the Post tags field works and allows for easier user searches.
3. All features + front end - the video will show the new friendly web interface such as upvoting and downvoting Posts/comments
