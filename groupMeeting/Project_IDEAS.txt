IDEAS and CONCEPTS interested in IMPLEMENT in the AGILE PROJECT

1. Higher upvote user has = cooler the profile pic (they could get drunker)
2. Instead of writing questions in the body of a post, users can upload files (limited size maybe)
3. Higher user-authenitication in the following areas:
  -  Making username unique for the user database
  -  3 password attempts limit
  -  ensure the password is at least 8 characters, includes letters, numbers, special characters, and does not contain part of the user's name/username (this one is extra)
  -  Email verfication to ensure user registers a valid email
4. Reset Password when user forget their password
5. Add new PAGES:
  -  Home page: this shows the user their own posts
  -  Profile page: this page shows the user's profile information, i.e. name, age, bio, university, degree, personal email, followers, etc.
  -  Profile edit page: possibly the same as the above page except when user clicks "edit" button they can update certain informantion.
  -  Explore page: this page shows the user, other people's posts
  -  Other's posts page: maybe when the user selects a post they are taken to a different page that has that post along with all of its comments rendered into the page.
